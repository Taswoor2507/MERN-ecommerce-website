## Create some files for

Basic Setup: The project begins with a basic setup, implying the initial steps required to get started.

## Configuration Files:

#### .prettierrc:

This file is used to configure the formatting rules for Prettier, a code formatter. It defines specific formatting preferences such as indentation, line width, and other code styling rules.

#### .prettierignore:

This file specifies files and directories that Prettier should ignore when formatting code. It allows excluding certain files or folders from the formatting process.

#### .gitignore:

This file is used to specify files and directories that Git should ignore when tracking changes. It prevents unnecessary files from being included in the version control system.

#### Purpose:

The creation of these files serves the purpose of setting up the project environment, ensuring consistent code formatting with Prettier, and managing version control with Git.

## 2nd setup

## Node Package Installation:

The project begins by installing essential Node.js packages using npm or yarn. These packages include:

## Express:

A web application framework for Node.js used for building web servers and APIs.

## Mongoose:

An ODM (Object-Document Mapper) for MongoDB and Node.js, used for simplifying interactions with MongoDB databases.

## dotenv:

A Node.js module for loading environment variables from a .env file into process.env.
Folder Structure:

## Frontend and Backend Folders:

The project is structured with separate folders for frontend and backend code, indicating a modular architecture to separate concerns.

## Backend Folder:

Inside the backend folder, there is a further division of files:

## server.js:

This file is likely the entry point for the Node.js server, responsible for starting the server and handling incoming HTTP requests.

## app.js:

This file likely contains the main application logic, including middleware setup, route definitions, and database connections using Express and Mongoose.

## Purpose:

This setup aims to organize the project codebase effectively, separating frontend and backend concerns to improve maintainability and scalability. It also facilitates better collaboration among team members working on different parts of the application

## Nodemon Installation:

The nodemon package is installed, likely using npm or yarn.
Nodemon is a utility that monitors changes in your Node.js application and automatically restarts the server whenever code changes are detected.

## Server Creation:

The process involves creating a server using Node.js.
Details such as how to create the server, what framework or library is used (e.g., Express.js), and any additional configurations or setup steps are not provided in the paragraph.

## Purpose:

Nodemon is installed to enhance the development workflow by automatically restarting the server upon code changes, eliminating the need for manual server restarts.
The server creation process is essential for setting up the backend infrastructure, allowing the application to handle incoming requests, define routes, and provide responses to clients.

## .env File Creation:

A .env file is created in the project directory.
The .env file typically stores environment variables used by the application.
Environment variables in the .env file can include sensitive information such as API keys, database credentials, and configuration settings.

## Purpose:

The .env file helps manage environment-specific configurations without hardcoding them into the codebase.
It enhances security by keeping sensitive information out of version control and limiting access to authorized personnel.
Environment variables defined in the .env file can be accessed by the application at runtime, allowing for dynamic configuration based on the environment.
